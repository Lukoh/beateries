  "body": "### BEatery(means Best+Eatery)\r\n\r\nThis is an Android application for finding the best eateries around the user using the [BEatery REST APIs](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/BEatery%20REST%20APIs.pdf). An Android App developer can see how to make some SNS or O2O service on Android via the BEatery source code. The BEatery App does not currently work because the BEatery Server does not set up yet. But I bet the BEatery App will runs well if the BEatery Server would be developed. (I have repeated the tests with some json data several times.)\r\n\r\n![Log-in](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/BEatery_Login.jpg?raw=true)\r\n![BEatery List](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/BEatery.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nQuick note is that you must provide **Facebook & Google+ access token** for the BEatery App in order to use this App. To get an token, you need to refer below link :\r\n\r\n[Google+](https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/android/sign-in?hl=en) \r\n[Google Sign-in](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start)\r\n[Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/android) \r\n\r\nYou also have to register BEatery project on the Google Developers Console and get a Google API key which you can add to BEatery. Note: There are various types of API keys. You need an Android key not a browser key.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the standard API, you need an Android key set up in BEatery project.\r\n\r\nTo get a Google API key, you need to refer below link :\r\n\r\n[Google Map-Android Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup) \r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nBEatery App consists of Model, UI, Web Controller, and so on.\r\n\r\n* `Model`- Responsible for storing data that is retrieved according to commands from the controller and displayed in the \r\n\tview\r\n* `UI` - Responsible for generating new output to the user based on changes in the model\r\n* `Web Controller` - Responsible for communicating between BEatery App and Web Server\r\n* `Service` - Responsible for handling all aspects of queueing of messages and delivery to client applications running on \ttarget devices(Google Cloud Messaging-GCM) \r\n* `Utility` - Responsible for optimizing, maintaining and supporting some task for BEatery App\r\n* `Helper` - Responsible for being used to assist in providing some functionality in BEarery App\r\n\r\nThe app does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Fetch all eateries around a user from the [EateryInfo List API](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/EateryList%20API.pdf) in JSON format\r\n2. Deserialize the JSON data for each of the eateries into `EateryInfo` objects\r\n3. Build an array of `EateryInfo` objects and create an `EateryInfoAdapter` for those eateries\r\n4. Define `getView` to define how to inflate a layout for each eatery row and display each eatery's data.\r\n5. Attach the adapter for the eateries to a RecyclerView to display the data on screen\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, there are four different components to bring the list of eatery's information in this app:\r\n\r\n1. `RequestClient & ResponseClient` - Responsible for executing the API requests and retrieving the JSON\r\n2. `EateryInfo` - Model object responsible for encapsulating the attributes for each individual eatery\r\n3. `EateryListAdapter` - Responsible for mapping each `EateryInfo` to a particular view layout\r\n4. `EateryListActivity` - Responsible for fetching and deserializing the data and configuring the adapter\r\n\r\nThe app leverages the [EateryInfo List API](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/EateryList%20API.pdf) which returns the following JSON response:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"entity\": [\r\n    {\r\n\t\"id\": 4324343,\r\n    \t\"country_code\": \"KR\",\r\n    \t\"name\": \"RiverSide Honey\",\r\n    \t\"best_menu\": \"Fish Soup, BBQ, Pork stew\",\r\n    \t\"address\": \"Riverside 11th road, Hansin 3 dong, Seocho-Gu, Seoul\",\r\n    \t\"telephone\": +82 02 521 4432,\r\n    \t\"website\": \"www.riverside.com\",\r\n    \t\"type\": \"Korean Traditional Restaurant\",\r\n    \t\"logo\": {\r\n      \t\t\"id\": 156043543,\r\n      \t\t\"url\": \"http://www.riverside.com/logo/156043543_logo.png\",\r\n      \t\t\"width\": 64,\r\n      \t\t\"height\": 64,\r\n      \t\t\"mime_type\": \"image/png\",\r\n      \t\t\"key\": \"eatery_logo\",\r\n      \t\t\"name\": \"riverside_logo\",\r\n      \t\t\"description\": \"riverside's main logo-the 50-year-old tradition of making…\"\r\n    \t},\r\n    \t\"preference\": 4,\r\n   \t    \"information\": \"A Brooklyn Heights favorite, this sleepy American tavern is a…\",\r\n    \t\"detail_information\": \"Exposed brick walls covered with old-fashioned clocks…\",\r\n    \t\"has_event\": true,\r\n    \t\"has_gallery\": true,\r\n    \t\"comment_count\": 304,\r\n    \t\"like_count\": 107\r\n\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"7706879\",\r\n      ...\r\n    },\r\n  ...\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the [BEatery REST APIs](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/BEatery%20REST%20APIs.pdf) on my cliffnotes for a step-by-step tutorial.\r\n\r\n### Libraries\r\n\r\nThis app leverages third-party libraries:\r\n\r\n * [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) - For asynchronous network requests\r\n * [EventBus](http://greenrobot.org/eventbus/) - For communication between Activiteis, Fragments, Servcie, etc\r\n * [ButterKnife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) - For field and method binding for Android views\r\n * [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - For an image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling\r\n * [image-chooser-library](https://github.com/coomar2841/image-chooser-library) - For choosing a imgage from gallery\r\n * [PhotoView](https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView) - For viewing a image\r\n * [SwipyRefreshLayout](https://github.com/OrangeGangsters/SwipyRefreshLayout) - For swiping in both direction\r\n * [FloatingActionButton](https://github.com/Clans/FloatingActionButton) - For using floating action button\r\n\r\n### To-Do Functionalities\r\n\r\nA couple of functionalities were not currently implmented into the BEatery App.\r\n\r\nSo some functionalities as listed below have to be implemented:\r\n\r\n * [Sharing] - For sharing the eatery's information to Facebook, Google+, Gmail, Twitter\r\n * [Request the review] - For requesting a review of the eatery\r\n\r\n### License\r\n```\r\nCopyright 2015-2016 Lukoh Nam\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n```",
