# BEatery(means Best+Eatery)

This is an Android application for finding the best eateries around the user using the [BEatery REST APIs](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/BEatery%20REST%20APIs.pdf). All Android App developer can see how to make some SNS or O2O service on Android via the BEatery source code. The BEatery App does not currently work because the BEatery Server does not set up yet. But I bet the BEatery App will runs well if the BEatery Server would be developed. (I have repeated the tests with some json data several times.) I'd welcome all server engineer who is so interested in BEatery open source project. (Please feel free to contact me if you have a litte bit interest in BEatery project.)

## Note

Build configuration is currently set to run on buildToolsVersion "24.0.0 rc3" and compileSdkVersion "android-N" in [build.gradle file](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/app/build.gradle).
If you want BEatery source would be run on Android 5.x version, please set buildToolsVersion, compileSdkVersion and dependencies in [build.gradle file](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/app/build.gradle) as below:

```
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

apply plugin: 'com.neenbedankt.android-apt'

android {
    compileSdkVersion 23
    buildToolsVersion "23.0.3"

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.goforer.beatery"
        minSdkVersion 18

        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
        multiDexEnabled true
        vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true
    }
    .....
    
    dependencies {
    	compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    	testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'

[Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/android) 

You also have to register BEatery project on the Google Developers Console and get a Google API key which you can add to BEatery. Note: There are various types of API keys. You need an Android key not a browser key.

If you're using the standard API, you need an Android key set up in BEatery project.

## Overview

BEatery App consists of Model, UI, Web Controller, and so on.

* `Model`- Responsible for storing data that is retrieved according to commands from the controller and displayed in the 
	view
* `UI` - Responsible for generating new output to the user based on changes in the model
* `Web Controller` - Responsible for communicating between BEatery App and Web Server
* `Service` - Responsible for handling all aspects of queueing of messages and delivery to client applications running on 	target devices(Google Cloud Messaging-GCM) 
* `Utility` - Responsible for optimizing, maintaining and supporting some task for BEatery App
* `Helper` - Responsible for being used to assist in providing some functionality in BEarery App

The app does the following:

1. Fetch all eateries around a user from the [EateryInfo List API](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/EateryList%20API.pdf) in JSON format
2. Deserialize the JSON data for each of the eateries into `EateryInfo` objects
3. Build an array of `EateryInfo` objects and create an `EateryInfoAdapter` for those eateries
4. Define `getView` to define how to inflate a layout for each eatery row and display each eatery's data.
5. Attach the adapter for the eateries to a RecyclerView to display the data on screen

To achieve this, there are four different components to bring the list of eatery's information in this app:

1. `RequestClient & ResponseClient` - Responsible for executing the API requests and retrieving the JSON
2. `EateryInfo` - Model object responsible for encapsulating the attributes for each individual eatery
3. `EateryListAdapter` - Responsible for mapping each `EateryInfo` to a particular view layout
4. `EateryListActivity` - Responsible for fetching and deserializing the data and configuring the adapter

The app leverages the [EateryInfo List API](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/EateryList%20API.pdf) which returns the following JSON response:

```json
{
  "entity": [
    {
	"id": 4324343,
    	"country_code": "KR",
    	"name": "RiverSide Honey",

    	},

   	    "information": "A Brooklyn Heights favorite, this sleepy American tavern is a…",
    	"detail_information": "Exposed brick walls covered with old-fashioned clocks…",
    	"has_event": true,
    	"has_gallery": true,
    	"comment_count": 304,
    	"like_count": 107

    },
    {
      "id": "7706879",
      ...
    },
  ...
  ]
}
```
