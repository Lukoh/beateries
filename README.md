# BEatery

This is an Android application for finding the best eateries using the [BEatery REST APIs](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/BEatery%20REST%20APIs.pdf). See the [BEatery REST APIs document](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/BEatery%20REST%20APIs.pdf) on our cliffnotes for a step-by-step tutorial.

## Installation

Quick note is that you must **provide your own API key** for RottenTomatoes in order to use this demo. To get an API key, you need to [register for an account](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/member/register) (or [sign in](https://secure.mashery.com/login/developer.rottentomatoes.com/)). Once you have the key, put the key into the `API_KEY` constant in the `src/com/codepath/example/rottentomatoes/RottenTomatoesClient.java` file: 

```java
public class RottenTomatoesClient {
  private final String API_KEY = "ENTER-KEY-HERE";
  // ...
}
```

Once you've setup the key and imported the project into Eclipse, you should be all set.

## Overview

The app does the following:

1. Fetch all eateries around a user from the [EateryInfo List API](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/EateryList%20API.pdf) in JSON format
2. Deserialize the JSON data for each of the eateries into `EateryInfo` objects
3. Build an array of `EateryInfo` objects and create an `EateryInfoAdapter` for those eateries
4. Define `getView` to define how to inflate a layout for each eatery row and display each eatery's data.
5. Attach the adapter for the eateries to a RecyclerView to display the data on screen

To achieve this, there are four different components in this app:

1. `RequestClient & ResponseClient` - Responsible for executing the API requests and retrieving the JSON
2. `EateryInfo` - Model object responsible for encapsulating the attributes for each individual eatery
3. `EateryListAdapter` - Responsible for mapping each `EateryInfo` to a particular view layout
4. `EateryListActivity` - Responsible for fetching and deserializing the data and configuring the adapter

The app leverages the [EateryInfo List API](https://github.com/Lukoh/beateries/blob/master/BEatery%20REST%20APIs.pdf) which returns the following JSON response:

```json
{
  "entity": [
